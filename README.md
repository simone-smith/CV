## Background

I am an ambitious and energetic student at Makers Academy, Europe's leading coding bootcamp. After 7 years in publishing, I have decided to build upon my strong logical, analytical and creative skills by learning to code and starting a new career as a developer.

I would like to work at a company that encourages me to continue learning and keep pushing myself to become a better developer, while providing an opportunity to do meaningful work in an environment that reflects the coding practices espoused by Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Clean code advocate
I believe firmly in the importance of clean, well-tested code. I endeavour to ensure that my code is DRY and adheres to the SOLID design principles, so as to write code that others can understand and that is easy to change. I use TDD to decrease the likelihood of introducing bugs, make my code easier to refactor, and provide confidence and focus to my development process.

#### Great collaborator
I'm at my best when working in a team or with a pair partner, and have honed my ability to deliver and receive feedback through practice and Makers Academy's emotional intelligence curriculum. I strive to apply XP values when collaborating on code with another person.

#### Fast, independent learner
I take a proactive approach to learning relevant new technologies for each project by reading the documentation and am diligent and persistent when it comes to acquiring new knowledge and skills.

#### Communication
While working in publishing, I attended international book fairs to meet publishers from all over the world.
Pitching books at book fairs or over the phone provided an excellent opportunity to hone my verbal presentation skills and make me a confident and clear communicator. I've been documenting my experience at Makers Academy on [Medium](https://medium.com/@simone_smith).

#### Logic and analytical thinking
Database management and royalty tracking software is a fundamental tool in the business of selling rights, and I've long been interested in optimising these tools for maximum efficiency and suitability. To this end, I implemented several new systems at ILA to improve administrative tasks, including the development of a royalty tracking system which succeeded in increasing the speed and efficiency with money is collected from publishers.

#### Languages
I speak Spanish and Russian to degree level. I am also competent in French and Hebrew, for which I attended weekly evening classes between 2013 and 2016.

## Interests

I love **reading** both fiction and non-fiction, hence the first career in publishing, and do so constantly and widely.
I make the most of London's **theatre** scene, and enjoy **travelling and being outdoors**, whether that involves **hiking** in the countryside or participating in my local weekly parkrun.
I regularly attend **tech meetups** in London, to meet like-minded people and learn about new ideas and developments.
